### Problem
Our customers want a way to create their own t-shirt designs. 
Make a simplified design editor that can support image uploading, resizing and rotation.

### Primary instructions
* Use the MyEAN stack (MySQL, ExpressJS, Angular 1.0, NodeJS) along with fabric.js
* Allow the ability for clients to upload, rotate and scale images and text within the editor
* Allow multiple images to be uploaded to the canvas
* Implement the ability to move layers forward and backward on the canvas
* Allow the designs to be saved and reopened

### Final steps
* Add me as a contributor to your github repo (my username is adamhpan). After you have completed the challenge, shoot me an email adampan@freshprints.com and I’ll count your last commit as your submission.
* Do not use any modules that are not listed within the specifications. If there’s something you really want to use, shoot me a message with it’s link and I’ll get back to you. (Prebuilt angular-fabric implementations are not allowed)
* Just the current one.
* We prefer that you use an existing angular directive or make your own. Please keep the use of jQuery to a minimum.
* The designs must be saved and retrievable at a later time. This means that the data cannot be stored in localstorage but in a static database.
* Implement an edit history for the editor like a undo and redo option
