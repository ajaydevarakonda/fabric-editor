### Problem
Make a simplified design editor that can support image uploading, resizing and rotation.

### Stack
* Stack used: ExpressJS, NodeJS, fabric.js

### Features
* Ability to upload, rotate and scale images and text within the editor
* Multiple image upload to the canvas
* Ability to move layers forward and backward on the canvas
* Design save and reopen (from a backend text file, I hope some one with malicious intent won't notice. Fingers crossed :p).
